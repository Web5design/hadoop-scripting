\section{Scenario: Wordcount}

In the following wordcount scenario the words in a document are counted by number of occurrence. This scenario fits the purpose of comparing the different approaches very well, because counting words is a classic Map/Reduce task. Furthermore programming a wordcount script is fairly easy and reduces the risk of us using a bad implementation for the benchmark.
