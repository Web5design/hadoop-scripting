\section{Scenario: Wordcount}

In the following wordcount scenario the words in a document are counted by number of occurrence. This scenario fits the purpose of comparing the different approaches very well, because counting words is a classic Map/Reduce task. Furthermore programming a wordcount script is fairly easy and therefore limits the impact of our programming skills against the benchmark results.

We have been running our scripts against a series of wikipedia articles with a size of 10 Mb, 50 Mb, 100 Mb, 500 Mb, 1000 Mb, 2000 Mb, 3000 Mb, 4000 Mb and 5000 Mb and 4 runs for each size.

Worth noting are:

Java has nearly no increase in runtime from 10 to 100 Mb. On the other hand Pig and Jaql already experience significant runtime increases.
