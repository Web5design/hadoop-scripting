\section{Benchmark: Markov Chain}

We have been running a Hadoop Java and a Pig implementation on the cluster against a series of Wikipedia articles with a size of 10 Mb to 2000 Mb. To minimise benchmark errors we have done 4 runs for each size.

It is clearly visible, that Pig is slower than the native Java implementation.
