We have been running a Hadoop Java and a Pig implementation on the cluster against a series of Wikipedia articles with a size of 10 Mb to 2000 Mb. To minimise benchmark errors we have done 4 runs for each size.

It is clearly visible, that Pig is slower than the native Java implementation. We were not able to run our Jaql implementation due to the problems mentioned before.
