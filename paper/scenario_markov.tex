\section{Scenario: Markov Chain} 

A Markov Chain is a logical construct for generating random texts, which appear to have a more or less sane content.\footnote{Indeed, there is a lot more one can do with Markov Chains.~\cite{wpMarkov}}. Texts are generated using a function that returns a random word following the given phrase in a predefined input text. One way to implement fast access to the input text is by creating an index of all phrases and their successors in the input text. In our Map/Reduce example we use articles from Wikipedia, which we split into tuples and return those as a SQL statement to be stored inside a database.
