\section{Benchmark: Wordcount}            

We have been running our Hadoop Java, Pig and Jaql scripts against a series of Wikipedia articles with a sizes between 10 Mb and 5000 Mb and 4 runs for each size.

It can be observed that Java performes better by an order of magnitude, compared to Pig and Jaql, which do not differ that much from each other. Apparently all do scale well, since execution time is growing slower than input size for all three implementations.
