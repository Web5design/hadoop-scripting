\section{Benchmark: Wordcount}            

We have been running our Hadoop Java, Pig and Jaql scripts against a series of Wikipedia articles with a size of 10 Mb, 50 Mb, 100 Mb, 500 Mb, 1000 Mb, 2000 Mb, 3000 Mb, 4000 Mb and 5000 Mb and 4 runs for each size.

Worth noting are:

Java has nearly no increase in runtime from 10 to 100 Mb. On the other hand Pig and Jaql already experience significant runtime increases.
