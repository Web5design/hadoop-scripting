\section{Cluster Setup}

All benchmarks were taken on the same cluster consisting of ten nodes. We used Hadoop version 0.18.3 since neither
Pig nor Jaql are compatible with the current version of Hadoop (0.20). Unfortunatly our nodes did vary in hardware,
especially in CPU and memory. While we had two faster Dell Opteron 755, the other nodes were rather slow (Dell GX 620).
Which caused some variation in performance when running with a small number of map or reduce tasks. In our oppinion,
for deployment a homogenous cluster would be more suited. We ran the latest version of Pig (0.3.0) against a development
snapshot of the upcomming Jaql 0.4\footnote{available at http://github.com/rkh/jaql}.
