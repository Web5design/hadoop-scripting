\section{Cluster Setup}

All benchmarks were taken on the same cluster consisting of ten nodes. Unfortunately our nodes did vary in hardware widely, especially in CPU and memory. While we had two faster Dell Opteron 755, the other nodes were rather slow Dell GX 620. This caused some variation in performance when running with a small number of map or reduce tasks since the workload of the faster nodes varied depending on how many tasks they have got assigned. In our opinion, for benchmarking a homogenous cluster would be more suited. We used Hadoop version 0.18.3 since neither Pig nor Jaql are compatible with the current version of Hadoop 0.20. We ran the latest version of Pig 0.3.0 and a development snapshot of the upcoming Jaql 0.4\footnote{available at http://github.com/rkh/jaql}. During the Markov Chain benchmarks we also tried Jaql 0.3 and both release candidates for Jaql 0.4.
