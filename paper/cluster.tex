\section{Cluster Setup}

All benchmarks were measured on the same cluster consisting of ten nodes. Unfortunately our nodes did vary in hardware widely, especially in CPU and memory. Two of the nodes were two upto four times faster than the others. This caused some variation in performance tests when running with a small number of map or reduce tasks, since the workload of the faster nodes varied depending on how many tasks they have got assigned. In our opinion a homogenous cluster would be more suited for benchmarking. We used Hadoop version 0.18.3 since neither Pig nor Jaql are compatible with the current version of Hadoop (0.20). We ran the latest version of Pig 0.3.0 and a development snapshot of the upcoming Jaql 0.4\footnote{available at http://github.com/rkh/jaql}. During the Markov Chain benchmarks we also tried Jaql 0.3 and both release candidates for Jaql 0.4.
