\section{Conclusion}                      

Both Pig and Jaql ease programming for Hadoop by allowing rapid development, compared to Hadoop's
Java interface. They are both in an early stage of development and cannot yet fully compete with
pure Java performance in our macro benchmarks.
                                                                                                             
Similarities and Differences between Pig and Jaql ... 

Both abstract from the Map/Reduce paradigm towards the actual data processing tasks.

Since Pig offers a rich ecosystem it clearly beats Jaql in terms of  ''programmer friendliness''.

Pig for small ''give me result now'' Jobs and Jaql for more complex?

Interesting things to come. Both aim on competing with Java performance.
