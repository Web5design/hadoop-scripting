Similarities and Differences between Pig and Jaql ... 

Both abstract from the Map/Reduce paradigm towards the actual data processing tasks.

Since Pig offers a rich ecosystem it therefore at the moment beats Jaql in terms of  ``programmer friendliness''. 

Pig faste at limits. Jaql stay within Jaql longer and don't fallback to Java UDF.

Time consuming part with Pig is writing UDFs. If library of commonly used UDFs is present (e.g. Open-Source Pig UDF Repository PiggyBank or company specific in-house) a Pig Latin script is composed in very short time. For a lot of common tasks, native Pig statements already are powerful enough and UDFs aren't needed.      

Since Pig and Jaql are still in development improvements may be seen, especially in performance, where both aim on competing with Java performance.

In conclusion, Pig and Jaql both ease programming for Hadoop by allowing rapid development, compared to Hadoop's
Java interface, but they are both in an early stage of development and cannot yet fully compete with
pure Java Hadoop performance in our macro benchmarks.
