The Implementation of Markov Chain \ref{pigmarkovstructure}   
                         
\begin{lstlisting}[language=pig,caption=Pig Latin Script Structure ,label=pigmarkovstructure]    
LOAD -> Split into 4-word tuples via SPLITSUC() -> GROUP the tuples -> Count and Group Duplicates -> Output as SQL via STORESQL()
\end{lstlisting}

Two UDFs had to be programmed. 
The first one is {\tt SPLITSUC()}, that is called within a {\tt FOREACH} Loop. It is splitting .
The other one is {\tt STORESQL()}
